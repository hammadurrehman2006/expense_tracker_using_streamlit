## 🚀 Welcome to the Journey!  
Hey there, growth seeker! Ready to take control of your finances *and* your mindset? This **Personal Expense Tracker** isn’t just an app—it’s a challenge to *embrace obstacles*, *learn from mistakes*, and *persist through difficulties*. Built with Python, Streamlit, and a dash of curiosity, this project proves that every line of code (and every dollar spent) is a step toward becoming better.  

Inspired by Carol Dweck’s *growth mindset*, this app helps you track expenses, visualize spending, and set goals—all while reminding you: *effort > perfection*. Let’s dive in!

## 🌟 What’s This All About?  
This Streamlit app lets you:  
- **Add Expenses:** Input date, amount, and category manually (because every small step counts).  
- **Upload CSVs:** Got a spending list? Drop it in and watch the magic happen.  
- **Set a Budget:** Define your limit and get a friendly nudge if you overspend.  
- **Visualize Growth:** See your spending habits in a pie chart and line graph—data is your teacher!  
- **Reset & Reflect:** Wipe the slate clean and start fresh, because learning never stops.  

It’s simple, practical, and packed with lessons—perfect for the *Growth Mindset Challenge*.

## 🛠️ How It Works  
Here’s the behind-the-scenes magic:  
1. **Tech Stack:**  
   - *Python* (because it’s the language of growth).  
   - *Streamlit* (for fast, interactive web apps).  
   - *Pandas* (to wrangle your expense data).  
   - *Plotly* (for gorgeous, interactive charts).  
2. **Features in Action:**  
   - Input expenses via a form or upload a CSV (`Date,Amount,Category`).  
   - Set a budget and track your progress in real-time.  
   - Visualize with a pie chart (category breakdown) and line graph (spending over time).  
3. **Mindset Twist:** Every feature encourages reflection—whether it’s tweaking your budget or learning from a buggy upload.
